As an engineering student, I will strive to make my dreams into realities.<br>

                                        <b>Position:</b> AESC Representative<br>
                                        <b>Major:</b> Computer Engineering<br>
                                        <b>Year:</b> Junior<br>
                                        <b>About Me:</b> Lately, I’ve been hula dancing and playing video games in my free time.  I love exploring and trying new things—usually in the form of food (dare I say that I might be a bigger foodie than Alven and Leon?)  I like to think of trying different foods as a cheaper way to travel the world and experience other cultures.<br>
                                        <b>Goals with PASE:</b> I want to help create a resource that my fellow classmates can use. Having some friends in the major, whether it be for study sessions or just venting about the next homework assignment, is something I have found to be very helpful over the semesters.  My hope is that PASE will provide a network that not only connects students to professionals in the industry but also to each other.

                                        <b>About Me:</b> A couple of things I wanna share with you guys is that I love listening to Hip-Hop since that's my favorite kind of music. I also love playing basketball since ball is life and last but not least, I have a strong passion for exploring and taking pictures since that's what I mostly do on my free time.<br>
                                        <b>Goals with PASE:</b> To connect with people with the same goals and hobbies as well as building meaningful relationships that will help us to become the person that we want to be. To also build networking opportunities that will set each other up for success in the field of engineering.

                                        <b>About Me:</b> I like piano, woodworking, writing, working out, swimming, eating out, exploring, getting lost, doing DIY and making crafts, stressing about school, finding new music and being a small audiophile, looking at mechanical keyboards, building computers, staying up to date on gaming news, going to Disneyland, doing photography and film, being a therapist, being an amateur masseuse and I think that's about it. Once in a while I'll go rockclimbing, LARPing, play DnD, catch up on EDC ideas, and that should be enough things to talk about with me if you want to hang out some time.<br>
                                        <b>Goals with PASE:</b> I hope to build a networks with people and make sure that everyone has a strong start to their college experience as it is very easy to fall behind by missing class one day or forgetting to do homework another day.
